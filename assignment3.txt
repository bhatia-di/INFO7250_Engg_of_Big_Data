PART 6. Programming Assignment

All hadoop commands are invoked by the bin/hadoop script. Running the hadoop script without any arguments prints the description for all commands.
Usage: hadoop [--config confdir] [--loglevel loglevel] [COMMAND] [GENERIC_OPTIONS] [COMMAND_OPTIONS] Execute each hadoop command once, and place the 
screenshots into a word file. If a command cannot be executed for any reason (such as, a distributed environment is needed), you may write the definition
of the command, and skip execution. http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/FileSystemShell.html
